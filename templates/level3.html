			<h2>Negotiation Tactics</h2>
			<div class="disclaimer">
				These strategies are not a guarantee for success. They are meant as a
				useful tips on how to prepare you for negotiations. They will not all
				apply in every situation.
			</div>

			<h4>Universal Strategies</h4>
			<div class="agnostic">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Lead with objective data instead of emotion to control the tone of
						the negotiation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use the vehicle’s lowest recorded price as your primary anchor
						point.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make them justify <i>their</i> number rather than defending your own
						offer.
					</li>
					<li>
						Reference comparable vehicles to create subtle leverage without
						bluffing.
					</li>
					<li>
						Demand a fully itemized OTD quote before engaging in any deeper
						discussion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep negotiation categories separate so the dealer can’t hide
						numbers in the mix.
					</li>
					<li>Refuse to counter an offer until the dealer moves first.</li>
					<li>
						Use silence or slow replies to apply pressure and break their
						momentum.
					</li>
					<li>Get every commitment in writing to prevent backtracking.</li>
					<li>
						Walk away when progress stalls to reset leverage and signal
						firmness.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div>
					For a more thorough explanation of these strategies, see
					<a href="#agnostic-definitions">'Universal Strategies Expanded'</a>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h4>In-Person Strategies</h4>
			<div class="in-person">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Stand up or shift position to control pacing when they stall or
						delay.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stay seated and don’t follow them to “manager rooms” to avoid their
						control tactics.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bring printed comparable listings to anchor your price with physical
						evidence.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use intentional silence after giving your number to create
						discomfort and movement.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stay in one place so the salesperson can't herd you through their
						environment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Maintain physical distance to avoid their proximity-based pressure
						tactics.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep facial reactions neutral so you don’t reveal interest or
						attachment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Delay the test drive until the numbers make sense to avoid emotional
						commitment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bring a silent witness to disrupt their rhythm and reduce
						manipulation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Politely decline drinks or small-talk rapport to stay objective and
						controlled.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div>

					<a href="#in-person-definitions">'In-Person Strategies Expanded'</a>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h4>Remote Strategies</h4>
			<div class="remote">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Delay responses strategically to create pressure and reduce their
						leverage.
					</li>
					<li>
						Run conversations with multiple dealerships at once to increase your
						alternatives.
					</li>
					<li>
						Send screenshots instead of links so your evidence is harder for
						them to dismiss.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use clean, prewritten scripts to stay concise and emotionless.
					</li>
					<li>
						Never reveal your maximum budget so they can’t anchor you high.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use written confirmations to lock down specifics and prevent
						shifting terms.
					</li>
					<li>
						Message early morning or near closing time when sales pressure is
						highest.
					</li>
					<li>
						Send a firm OTD offer when needed to quickly test their flexibility.
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep each negotiation thread focused on a single category to avoid
						confusion.
					</li>
					<li>
						End the conversation immediately when value stops to regain
						leverage.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Universal Strategies - Expanded</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Here are the ones that actually work in both settings and don’t rely
					on theatrics, geography, or “car-lot psychology.” These are universal
					because they’re anchored in information leverage, timing, and framing.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Anchor the Conversation With Data, Not Emotion</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>Always lead with verifiable information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Prior listing prices</li>
					<li>Market averages (KBB, CarGurus IMV, your own price deltas)</li>
					<li>Mileage deviations</li>
					<li>Options packages and missing features</li>
					<li>Warranty status</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Instead of “Can you do better?” you say:<br />
					<strong
						>“Based on the vehicle’s age, mileage, price history, and options,
						its fair value sits closer to X.”</strong
					><br />
					Works exactly the same whether typed or spoken.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Use the Lowest Historical Price as Your Anchor</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					If the car ever dropped lower, that number becomes the real bargaining
					floor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dealers <em>hate</em> being reminded of their own history because it’s
					hard to refute.<br />
					This line works in email, text, phone, or face-to-face:<br />
					<strong
						>“On [date], this vehicle was listed at $X. That’s the most reliable
						indicator of its fair market value.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Make Them Justify the Price</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Never justify <em>your</em> offer. Make <em>them</em> defend theirs.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>“Can you help me understand the basis for this price?”</strong
					><br />
					It forces them off their script and often reveals weak points (market
					adjustments, reconditioning fluff, “manager said so”). Equally
					effective over email or live.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Create Alternatives (Leverage Through Options)</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Always reference other units you are considering. Not as a threat, but
					as context.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>“I’m looking at a few comparable options, so I’m aiming for
						whichever dealership gives the clearest, most straightforward
						number.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					That line works identically in-person or remotely because it shifts
					them out of high-pressure mode.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Avoid Their Time-Pressure Tactics</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Deadlines like “the deal expires today” are fake. Respond the same way
					every time:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>“If the numbers work, I’ll move quickly. Otherwise I’m comfortable
						waiting.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					This shuts down one of their most common manipulation tools. Works in
					any channel.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Separate Negotiation Tracks</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>Always separate:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Vehicle price</li>
					<li>Trade-in</li>
					<li>Financing</li>
					<li>Warranty</li>
					<li>Add-ons</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Never let them merge categories.</p>
				<p>
					When they try to lump things (“We can do $X but only if you finance”),
					respond with the universal line:<br />
					<strong>“Let’s settle the vehicle price first.”</strong>
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong
						>Commit to Numbers Only After They Commit to Transparency</strong
					>
				</h3>
				<p>
					You never reveal your max until they reveal their real out-the-door
					number.
				</p>
				<p>
					The universal script:<br />
					<strong
						>“Before I consider anything, I need the full OTD with all fees
						itemized.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Doesn’t matter if it’s an email or a sales desk conversation; the
					effect is the same.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Silence as a Tool</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Say your offer, then shut up.<br />
					On email/text: send one message and don’t follow up immediately.<br />
					In-person: sit quietly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Salespeople fill silence by lowering numbers. This works everywhere.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Pre-Write Your Walk-Away Line</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>Have a default, emotion-free exit:</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>“I appreciate the effort, but these numbers don’t align with the
						vehicle’s valuation. If things change, reach out.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Doesn’t burn the bridge and puts the ball in their court. Dealers
					often call back with better numbers.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Never Negotiate Against Yourself</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>If they say “Can you meet me in the middle?” you respond:</p>
				<p>
					<strong>“I’m waiting for your updated offer.”</strong><br />
					or<br />
					<strong
						>“I need to see movement on your side before adjusting
						anything.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>Both function over email or spoken.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Get Everything in Writing</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Even if you're in person, request written numbers:<br />
					<strong>“Email me the OTD so I can review it.”</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Removes pressure, creates a paper trail, and prevents last-minute fee
					changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want, I can condense these into a one-page cheat sheet tailored
					to your negotiation style (firm, data-driven, low-emotion) so you can
					drop it into your Level 3 logic later.
				</p>

			<h2>In-Person Strategies - Expanded</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Here are the ones that matter
					<strong>only in person</strong> and actually make a difference. No
					fluff, no theatrics.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Control the pacing by standing up</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					If the conversation drags or they try to “go talk to the manager,”
					stand up and gather your things a bit.
				</p>
				<p>
					You don’t leave. You just signal:<br />
					<strong>“I won’t sit here wasting time.”</strong>
				</p>
				<p>It forces them to speed up and come back with a real number.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Don’t follow them to the manager’s office</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Stay seated where you are.<br />
					If they want to “check,” let them walk back and forth.
				</p>
				<p>
					This keeps <em>you</em> as the “customer in control,” not the
					supplicant being walked around the dealership maze.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Bring your own printed comps</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Hard copies hit harder than a phone screen.<br />
					When they push back on price:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>“These are similarly equipped vehicles in the same market. I’m
						aligning to these numbers.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>Paper forces them to take it seriously.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Use physical silence</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Phone/email silence is passive.<br />
					In-person silence is uncomfortable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Say your number, then shut up. Look at them.<br />
					Humans fill silence by conceding. This works absurdly well physically.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Don’t let them herd you</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>Salespeople try to control environment:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>“Let’s sit over here.”</li>
					<li>“Come look at this screen.”</li>
					<li>“Follow me to the desk.”</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Pick a spot you prefer and stay there.<br />
					This stops the subtle psychological pressure of being moved through
					“their” space.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Don’t let them sit on your side of the desk</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Some will try to sit
					<em>next</em> to you to “go over numbers together.”<br />
					This is a pressure tactic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Say:<br />
					<strong>“I’m good. You can stay there.”</strong>
				</p>
				<p>That physical distance keeps you objective and in control.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong
						>Mirror their first offer with body language, not words</strong
					>
				</h3>
				<p>
					When they hand you a high number, just lean back slightly and raise
					eyebrows.<br />
					Don’t respond immediately.
				</p>
				<p>
					This tells them the number is unrealistic without you having to say
					anything.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Never accept “monthly payment conversations”</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					If they pivot to payment amounts on a screen, physically gesture
					toward the full price:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>“We’re talking about the OTD, not payments.”</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Pointing physically redirects them and keeps the conversation on your
					terms.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Walk away once, calmly</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Walking away incorrectly looks emotional or bluff-like.<br />
					Done right, it's controlled and silent.
				</p>
				<p>
					If they stall, say:<br />
					<strong>“I think I’m done for today.”</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Stand, shake a hand, and start heading out.<br />
					This move almost always pulls out the real number.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Bring time limits that are real, not fake</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>Salespeople weaponize time. Use your own version:</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>“I have to be somewhere in 35 minutes, so let’s keep it
						straightforward.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>Shortens the BS cycle dramatically.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Avoid the test drive trap</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					They want you emotionally invested.<br />
					If you already know the car is good and you’re just negotiating price,
					skip the test drive until numbers are serious.
				</p>
				<p>
					Say:<br />
					<strong>“We can drive it once the price is nailed down.”</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This kills one of their strongest psychological levers.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Control your facial reactions</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Never show excitement.<br />
					Even subtle cues (“Nice interior!”) give them leverage.
				</p>
				<p>Stay neutral until paperwork is done.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Bring a “quiet witness”</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Someone with you who says nothing.<br />
					Salespeople hate this because:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They can’t influence the second person.</li>
					<li>It slows their rhythm.</li>
					<li>They feel observed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Great psychological tool.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Don’t drink anything they offer</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					It’s not poison; it’s rapport building.<br />
					Keep interactions polite but not cozy.<br />
					Maintains emotional distance and keeps you harder to manipulate.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want a trimmed, no-BS version in a single-page cheat sheet, I
					can hand you that too.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id="remote-definitions">
			<h2>Remote Strategies - Expanded</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>
					<strong>Control the pace with delayed responses</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					In person, silence works.<br />
					Remotely,
					<strong>delayed replies</strong> do the same thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					If they send a weak counteroffer, don’t respond right away.<br />
					Let them feel the deal slipping.
				</p>
				<p>Nothing pressures a salesperson more than a “cooling” customer.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Run parallel conversations</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Remote lets you work multiple dealerships at once.<br />
					This creates leverage without bluffing.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can literally send:<br />
					<strong
						>“Another dealer is closer to the price I’m targeting, but I like
						your unit more. Can you sharpen the number?”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					This hits harder remotely because they know you’re typing the same
					thing to someone else.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Use screenshot anchors</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>Send screenshots of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>their previous lower price</li>
					<li>competitors’ listings</li>
					<li>valuation ranges</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Screenshots beat links because they’re harder to dismiss or deny, and
					they visually reinforce market reality.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Always force OTD numbers upfront</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>Dealers love hiding fees until the end.</p>
				<p>
					Remote negotiations allow you to demand complete transparency before
					moving forward:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>“Please send the itemized out-the-door price so I can compare
						apples to apples.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					They hate this, but they usually comply because there’s no in-person
					pressure advantage for them.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Copy-paste micro scripts</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Remote means you can use pre-written exact responses without emotional
					drift.
				</p>
				<p>Examples:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong
								>“That number doesn’t align with current market data.”</strong
							>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong
								>“I’m firm on my position until I see movement on the dealership
								side.”</strong
							>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>“Let me know when you can get closer to X.”</strong>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Perfect tone, every time, no fatigue.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Never reveal your ceiling</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Remote removes the social pressure to “be honest.”<br />
					You can stay completely opaque.
				</p>
				<p>
					If they ask for your budget:<br />
					<strong>“Depends entirely on the numbers you present.”</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This is much easier to deliver cleanly in text.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Pin them down on specifics using written records</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Anything verbal can be changed.<br />
					Anything written can’t.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remote gives you a paper trail:<br />
					<strong
						>“Just to confirm, you’re offering X OTD with no add-ons?”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>Dealers will avoid contradicting their own written words.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Use time-of-day strategically</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Early mornings and right before closing are best for remote.<br />
					Why?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fewer customers contacting them</li>
					<li>Salespeople want quick wins</li>
					<li>End-of-day fatigue makes them more flexible</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Remote lets you hit those rhythms perfectly.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Send one-off hard offers</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					In person, “hard offers” can feel confrontational.<br />
					Remote, they’re clean.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>“I’m ready to move forward today at $X OTD. If that works, send the
						buyer’s order.”</strong
					>
				</p>
				<p>Clear. Direct. Zero drama.</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Let the dealer chase you</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>
					If they stop responding, don’t chase.<br />
					Remote communication amplifies scarcity.
				</p>
				<p>
					A single message like:<br />
					<strong>“Still letting me know if you can get closer to X.”</strong
					><br />
					…makes them re-engage.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong>Negotiate multiple parts asynchronously</strong>
				</h3>
				<p>You can handle:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>vehicle price</li>
					<li>shipping</li>
					<li>add-on removal</li>
					<li>warranties</li>
					<li>
						trade-in valuation<br />
						…in separate message threads, without them trying to merge it into
						one messy conversation.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Remote gives you compartmentalization that’s nearly impossible
					in-person.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<strong
						>End the conversation exactly when it stops providing value</strong
					>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This is the remote version of walking out.<br />
					Just stop replying.
				</p>
				<p>
					They’ll come back with something better or move on.<br />
					Either way, you lose nothing.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want this distilled into a ultra-compact checklist you can drop
					into your scripts or Level 3 negotiation notes, I can give you that
					too.
