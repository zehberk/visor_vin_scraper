Review this Level 1 report. Your goal is to provide a concise early-stage market takeaway, not a deep listing-by-listing analysis. Focus on: (1) overall market viability for this make/model, (2) whether most listings are priced above, below, or near FMV, (3) how strong the selection is across trims/years, (4) what this means for negotiation leverage, and (5) whether it’s worth advancing to Level 2 analysis now or waiting. Keep your response to 8–10 sentences and avoid repeating raw data from the report. Instead, summarize the patterns and give me a clear conclusion on next steps.
